  [Key responsibilities]
  
  * Participated in the research program “EAST-CITIES: Establishing and Achieving Sustainability Targets in Eastern Chinese Cities”.
  * Studied on the building materials and energy consumption of Qingdao industrial buildings.

  [General steps]

  * Searched the literature and database and determined the main structure type of Qingdao industrial buildings (steel structure, steel-concrete composite structure), and its material consumption range and energy use form.
  * Established the typical building models with Revit and energy simulation models with DesignBuilder.
  * Simulated and analyzed the material use, energy consumption and CO2 emission of each typical building.
  * Proposed a series of sustainable strategies for future industrial buildings.

  [Innovation]

  * Established typical building models in different time periods under different energy-efficient standards, which have also affected the material use and energy consumption.
  * Took foundation components into account.

  [Output]
  * One abstract submitted to International Workshop on Health - Energy Efficiency & Intelligent Building Systems (HEIBS) to be hold in 2021.
  * One inspired study on the application of rooftop PV systems in lightweight steel-structured industrial buildings, accepted by the conference Alternative & Renewable Energy Quest in Architecture and Urbanism (AREQ) in 2020.
