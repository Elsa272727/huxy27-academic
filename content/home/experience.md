    Key Responsibilities
    * Participated in the research program “EAST-CITIES: Establishing and Achieving Sustainability Targets in Eastern Chinese Cities”
    * Studied on the building materials and energy consumption of Qingdao industrial buildings

    |- General steps
    * Searched the literature and database and determined the main structure type of Qingdao industrial buildings (steel structure, steel-concrete composite structure), and its material consumption range and energy use form
    * Established the typical building models with Revit and energy simulation models with DesignBuilder
    * Simulated and analyzed the material use, energy consumption and CO2 emission of each typical building
    * Proposed a series of sustainable strategies for future industrial buildings

    |- Innovation
    * Established typical building models in different time periods under different energy-efficient standards, which have also affected the material use and energy consumption
    * Took foundation components into account

    |- Output
    * One abstract submitted to International Workshop on Health - Energy Efficiency & Intelligent Building Systems (HEIBS) to be hold in 2021
    * One inspired study on the application of rooftop PV systems in lightweight steel-structured industrial buildings, accepted by the conference Alternative & Renewable Energy Quest in Architecture and Urbanism (AREQ) in 2020
